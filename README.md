# Fitness Class Booking Application

## Overview
This application allows users to choose and book fitness classes. It includes features for user management, class scheduling, booking, waitlisting, and cancellations.

## Features
1. **User Management:**
   - **Registration and Login:** Users can register and log in to the system.
   - **User Tiers:** Users are categorized into three tiers with different booking limits:
     - **Platinum:** 10 classes
     - **Gold:** 5 classes
     - **Silver:** 3 classes

2. **Packages:**
   - User tiers align with packages, determining the number of classes a user can book.

3. **Classes:**
   - **Types:** Classes include yoga, gym, dance, etc.
   - **Capacity:** Each class has a maximum number of attendees.
   - **Scheduling:** Classes are scheduled at specific times, and multiple classes can run in a single day.

4. **Booking:**
   - Users can book a class if it has not reached capacity.
   - An admin can create, schedule, and cancel classes.
   - **Waitlisting:** If a class is full, users can join a waitlist. When a booked user cancels, the first user on the waitlist is allocated the slot.
   - **Cancellation:** Users can cancel their booking up to 30 minutes before the class starts. Admins can also cancel classes.
